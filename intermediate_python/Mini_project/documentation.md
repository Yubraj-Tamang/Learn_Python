# Personal Expense Tracker

## Project Overview
The **Personal Expense Tracker** is a Python application that allows you to track your daily expenses by logging them into a file. The application uses the `datetime` module to record the date and time of each expense, categorizes the expenses, and provides features to view, filter, and calculate total expenditures. It stores the expenses in a text file (`expenses.txt`) for easy access and analysis.

## Features
- **Log Expenses**: Add expenses with the date, category, and amount.
- **View All Expenses**: Display all the logged expenses.
- **Filter by Category**: View expenses for a specific category (e.g., Food, Transport, etc.).
- **Total Expenses**: Calculate the total amount spent over a specified period or category.
- **File-based Storage**: All expenses are stored in a text file for persistence.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **datetime module**: For handling date and time of each expense.
